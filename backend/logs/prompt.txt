    prompt = f"""You are an expert academic information extractor. Read the following syllabus data and extract only **individual subjects** (not specializations, mentions, degree branches, general itineraries, or titles of thematic areas).

A **subject** is a specific academic unit that has its own program, technical content, objectives, etc. Do not confuse a specialization (such as "Computing", "Information Systems", etc.) with a subject. Subjects usually include titles with the name + number of credits, course, or code (for example: "PROGRAMMING I (6 ECTS)", "MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS II", "PROGRAMMING I - 103481914").

For each detected subject, extract exclusively:
- Exact name of the subject (without credits or course info)
- General competences acquired by the student (what skills or capabilities are expected to be developed)
- Main objectives (what knowledge or skills are expected for the student to acquire)
- Technical and specific content covered (key topics, blocks or modules, technologies, languages, etc.)

The output must be in this exact format:

{{
    "Subject Name": {{
        "competences": "General competences acquired by the student.",
        "objectives": "Learning objectives for the subject.",
        "content": "List of topics covered in the subject."
    }},
    ...
}}
