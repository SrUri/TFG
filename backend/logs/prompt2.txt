prompt = f"""You are an expert academic information extractor. Read the following syllabus data and extract only **individual subjects** (not specializations, mentions, degree branches, general itineraries, or titles of thematic areas).

A **subject** is a specific academic unit that has its own program, technical contents, objectives, etc. Do not confuse a specialization (such as "Computing", "Information Systems", etc.) with a subject. Subjects usually include titles with the name + number of credits, course, or code (for example: "PROGRAMMING I (6 ECTS)", "MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS II", "PROGRAMMING I - 103481914").

Extract all subjects and return their competences, objectives and contents in JSON format.

For each detected subject, extract exclusively:
- Exact name of the subject (without credits or course info)
- General competences acquired by the student (what skills or capabilities are expected to be developed)
- Main objectives (what knowledge or skills are expected for the student to acquire)
- Technical and specific contents covered
**BE VERY THOROUGH AND INCLUDE ALL DETAILS OF CONTENTS.**

For each subject, return ONLY these fields in JSON format:
{{
    "Subject Name": {{
        "competences": "General competences (1-2 sentences max)",
        "objectives": "Learning objectives (3-5 bullet points)",
        "contents": "Very detailed contents (structured as bullet points)"
    }},
    ...
}}

STRICT RULES:
1. ALWAYS use this exact structure
2. Contents MUST be bullet points (start with '-')
3. Remove any credits, course codes from subject names
4. Exclude empty fields
5. For contents, include ALL topics but keep them concise

Example output:
{{
    "Programming I": {{
        "competences": "Ability to design algorithms and write programs",
        "objectives": "- Understand programming basics\\n- Develop problem-solving skills\\n- Learn to debug code...",
        "contents": "- Variables and data types\\n- Control structures\\n- Functions\\n- Basic algorithms..."
    }}
}}

IMPORTANT: If the source text is in a language other than English (such as Catalan or Spanish), **automatically TRANSLATE** the contents to Spanish before returning the JSON.

The input text is as follows:
{translated_text}
